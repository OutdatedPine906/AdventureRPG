# Aleron's Curse
This is the Final Project for Chris Barnes and Max Lampert for AP Computer Science A at Avon High School.
 
SOURCES:

Most of the framework for this game was created with the help of CodeNMore's "NEW Beginner 2D Game Programming" playlist on youtube.
This playlist is linked below:

Small questions that I have had about doing specific things(like rotating one of the bridges) have been taken from various posts www.stackoverflow.com, but nothing major has come from there. Mostly questions about ArrayList editing and rotating images was looked for.
